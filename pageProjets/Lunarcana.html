                <h1> Game Description </h1>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                  ‚ú® Experience the Magic ‚ú®<br><br>
                  The main objective of the game is to progress through a tower populated by increasingly formidable bosses. To accomplish this task, you will have a team of characters at your disposal, which you can obtain through various summons. Each of these characters falls into different available categories. During battles, if two characters share the same category and are placed side by side, they will benefit from boosted statistics.
                  <br><br>
                  ‚õ©Ô∏è Tower Ascent ‚õ©Ô∏è <br><br>
                  Ascending the tower is an intense adventure, with floors becoming progressively more difficult and bosses increasingly formidable. Each floor represents a growing challenge for the team of heroes. The active and passive skills of the characters are crucial during battles, enabling them to inflict massive damage or provide tactical advantages.
                  <br><br>
                  Coordination is crucial to maximize the effectiveness of each character's skills. Furthermore, each character's type influences the damage they deal and withstand. Using characters with a type advantage over the current boss increases damage while reducing risks.
                  <br><br>
                  As the team progresses, bosses become more and more formidable, requiring meticulous planning and a deep understanding of the characters' skills. Each victory is hard-earned, but the hope of reaching the top of the tower continues to motivate heroes to overcome all obstacles.
                  <br><br>
                  ü§ù Create Your Own Team ü§ù <br><br>
                  Create the ultimate formation by gathering iconic characters, all led by their category leader. Embark on a quest to find your favorite heroes to face the challenge of multiple tower floors. In this epic quest, you'll need to harness the unique skills of each character to triumph over formidable bosses and continuously advance higher in the tower, ready to face ever-greater challenges. The fate of the universe rests in your hands, so assemble the best team and write your own legend!
                  <br><br>
                  ü•∑ Upgrade Your Characters ü•∑ <br><br>
                  Character enhancement is at the core of the game. Each character can level up by participating in battles, especially against bosses, who provide valuable experience potions. However, another dimension of power is awakening, accessible to certain characters. By awakening, they become rarer and more powerful. To trigger this awakening, players must complete special quests by defeating special tower bosses. Evolving characters is essential to overcome upcoming challenges. It's a strategic quest where every choice matters to reach the tower's heights.
                  <br><br>
                  üöß Work in Progress üöß <br><br>
                  Remember that the game is still in development, and what you see today is just a glimpse of the magic we can create. I am working to refine gameplay, improve graphics, and ensure a smooth gaming experience once it's finally in your hands.
                  <br><br>
                  Thank you for joining us on this exciting adventure. Until then, may the magic be with you! ‚ú®
